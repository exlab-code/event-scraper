  "patterns": [
    "Events focus on digital transformation topics but do not explicitly mention non-profit contexts.",
    "Several events are related to IT security, AI, and data protection, which are critical for both non-profit and for-profit sectors.",
    "Tags often include 'Kostenlos', suggesting free access, which might be more relevant for non-profit organizations.",
    "Many events are webinars or online seminars, indicating accessibility which is typically important for non-profit organizations.",
    "Events discussing regulations, legal aspects, and compliance, which might indirectly appeal to non-profits seeking to understand digital governance."
  ],
  "rules": [
    "Consider events with 'Kostenlos' and 'Webinar' tags as potentially relevant, requiring further analysis for non-profit context.",
    "Identify keywords like 'Vereine', 'Gemeinn√ºtzig', or 'Non-Profit' in descriptions and tags to validate non-profit relevance.",
    "Include events with clear educational or training purposes related to digital transformation as potentially relevant.",
    "Flag events discussing compliance, legal, or regulatory aspects tied to digital transformation for non-profit relevance.",
    "Consider events with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as potentially relevant, given their overlap with non-profit goals.",
    "Incorporate context analysis for terms like 'Barrierefreiheit' as they might relate to non-profit objectives.",
    "Prioritize events with an explicit focus on enhancing skills or capabilities crucial for digital transformation."
  ],
  "guidelines": [
    "Focus on events that provide actionable insights or skills relevant to digital transformation.",
    "Ensure events have an educational component, which is often a priority for non-profits.",
    "Events should offer free access or resources, aligning with non-profit accessibility needs.",
    "Look for explicit or implicit indications of serving community or social objectives, even if not directly labeled as non-profit.",
    "Consider broad themes of sustainability, accessibility, and compliance as part of digital transformation relevant to non-profits."
  ],
  "criteria_modifications": [
    "Expand the definition of non-profit relevance to include events that serve educational purposes or community benefit.",
    "Allow for implicit non-profit relevance if events focus on widely applicable digital transformation tools or skills.",
    "Incorporate a secondary analysis for free and accessible events to assess potential non-profit relevance.",
    "Adjust criteria to recognize the potential overlap between non-profit and SME digital transformation challenges."
  ],
  "summary": "The misclassification of events as 'not relevant' stems primarily from a narrow interpretation of non-profit relevance, focused explicitly on direct mentions rather than potential implicit connections. Many of these events, while not explicitly labeled for non-profits, provide educational, compliance-related, or accessible content that aligns with non-profit goals. By refining the criteria to recognize implicit relevance, especially through educational offerings, accessibility, and community-oriented themes, the system can better classify events as relevant for the non-profit sector."
