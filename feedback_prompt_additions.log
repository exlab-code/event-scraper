FEEDBACK ANALYSIS:

Common patterns in relevant events:
- Events include aspects of digital transformation but lack explicit non-profit context
- Events are tagged with digital transformation-related keywords
- Focus on specific digital tools or techniques applicable to various sectors
- Events offer practical applications or workshops on digital skills
- Inclusion of topics like IT security, AI, and data management

Rules for identifying relevant events:
- If an event includes digital transformation and mentions a community or educational context, consider it potentially relevant
- Events focusing on enabling digital competencies for broader public or community groups should be flagged for further review
- Workshops or seminars that offer free participation and involve digital transformation themes should be considered for relevance
- Flag events that aim to improve digital literacy or IT security awareness for potential non-profit relevance
- If an event is tagged with 'Vereine', 'Gemeinschaft', or similar, and involves digital transformation, consider it relevant

Guidelines for relevance assessment:
- Focus on events that provide digital skills or innovative solutions for community or educational purposes
- Consider the broader impact of digital transformation events on non-profit or community settings
- Evaluate the accessibility of events, such as free workshops or seminars, as potential indicators of non-profit engagement
- Assess the potential for events to improve public digital literacy or provide IT security education
- Look for references to community improvement, social impact, or educational initiatives alongside digital themes

Modified relevance criteria:
- Allow for relevance determination when there is a broader community or educational impact alongside digital transformation
- Include a clause for events that offer digital training or IT security awareness as potentially relevant
- Expand the criteria to recognize digital transformation efforts that benefit public or community sectors
- Consider the accessibility and public availability of events as a factor in determining relevance
- Incorporate a broader interpretation of non-profit context to include community or social impact

Summary: The analysis reveals a pattern where events are focused on digital transformation topics but lack explicit non-profit references. The current criteria may be too restrictive, missing events that, while not explicitly non-profit, offer significant community benefits or digital literacy improvements. By expanding the criteria to include events with broader public or educational impacts, and by considering accessibility and social impact, the system can better identify relevant events for non-profit digital transformation.
